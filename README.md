Delphi Expression Evaluater
===========================

This library is based on the prExpr.pas unit:
- the original works of Martin Lafferty:
- Copyright:   1997 Production Robots Engineering Ltd, all rights reserved.
- Version:     1.03 31/1/98

Martin was good enough to grant non-exclusive usage and distribution rights to anyone in need of a great expression evaluator.
(see copyright notice inside prExpr.pas)

In 1997 prExpr was among the fastest and most reliable of them all and maybe still is.
As time went on I made some changes to the orriginal code and extended the base expression parser with two extra units!

Currently I still use this library extensivvly in production enviroments and have never had to need anything else for parsing expression in Delphi applications

I could not find any new work by Martin on the prExpr code, so I thought it would be nice to share his work with mine to the world on Git!.

Please enjoy using the library.
