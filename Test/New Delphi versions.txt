In the Delphi version specific project file (dproj) the file 'TestExprEval.dpr'
is referenced without a Delphi version specific suffix.

To compile the project using a different Delphi version (newer/older),
please do the following;
* Create a copy of 'dproj' file that is the most recent PREVIOUS 
  version of the Delphi version you need to create
* Name this file accodingly the naming convention for the new Dlephi version.


NOTE:
Never change the filename of the 'dpr' file!!!
